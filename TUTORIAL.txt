[=======================================================]
This directory contains the following files and programs:

 -rwxr-xr-x  al2tex.pl 

It's a script in perl. It takes as argument a properly formatted xml
file and create a LaTeX file, ready to be compiled. 

 -rwxr-xr-x  drupal2latex 

This script is meant to be used normally to produce pdfs. It uses
al2tex.pl as backend, compile the .tex and using ghostscript impose
the pdfs, if the number of the letter formatted pdf is between 4 and
60 (ie, skip the very short and the very long ones).

 -rwxr-xr-x  htmlpp 

It's a very rough script that takes as argument a HTML page. It
filters the html tags, to preserve it for the processing (see below).

 -rwxr-xr-x  preparing_for_the_upload.sh 

This script takes as argument xml file. It cleans the symbol produced
by htmlpp (if any) and build the headers of the xml files.

 -rwxr-xr-x  uploadthepdfs 

It's a deprecated wrapper to upload the pdfs to the server. Don't use
it and build them on the server, if you're a "pdf-maintainer" 
If you use it, you have to modify the user and port values.

 -rw-r--r--  Makefile

It contains just a few lines of code, and you need to setup it
correctly (setting the destination of the .tex and .pdf). If you're
familiar with "make", you should know it uses the timestamp. 
Used to build the pdfs without getting crazy, as make detects if a
file changed and need a rebuilding.

 -rwxr-xr-x  tagadelic.sh

A filter to build the tag list on drupal. Nothing special.

 -rwxr-xr-x  wiki-author-parser.sh

A filter that process the wiki table with the uploads and create a
the Index page. 



** INSTALLATION **

Move the files in a directory in your $PATH (check with the command:
echo $PATH), e.g. (if ~/bin is in your $PATH)

 mv *.sh htmlpp drupal2latex al2tex.pl uploadthepdfs ~/bin 

However, if you downloaded the stuff from the git, I suggest you to
link them in the $PATH directory, to stay up-to-date with the exciting
news.

** USAGE **

Download the source html page, e.g.

 wget http://www.primitivism.com/abolition.htm

Next, run htmlpp against it:

 htmlpp abolition.htm 

This will create a new html file, abolition.htm.new, and will open it
with firefox. As you will notice, it will look strange, because has
the bold and italics text markerd with @@@italics@@@ and so on. Don't
worry, it will be fine.

Copy and paste from the weird page in an empty file. I suggest you to
call it Name_Surname__The_title.xml,
e.g. Bob_Black__The_Abolition_of_Work.xml (please note the 2
underscores between name and title). Save and close it.

Now run the preparing_for_the_upload.sh against it:

 preparing_for_the_upload.sh Name_Surname__The_title.xml

The script will ask some questions and build the header. 

The text should be ready for the upload, but you still need to fix
notes, chapter, typos and so on. However, does a nice job, fixing
annoying things like quote, preserving the italics and similar and
adding the header.

If you want to convert it to .pdf, use the drupal2latex script against
the .xml file. You'll need the ucs package (latex-ucs on debian),
lmodern, enumerate and href packages. Please note that these packages
are bundled with TeXlive. (On recent debian, apt-get install
texlive-full, and you're done, even if is a +1G installation). 

This is a template of the header.
Please don't break the lines.

If something fails, please report the problem. 

* Makefile

If you want to manage the archive, you'll find the Makefile very
useful.Please edit the TEXDIRECTORY and PDFDIRECTORY variables to
suite your needs, put it in the alibrary directory and run make. This
will keep the archive up-to-date, rebuilding the pdfs that need a
refresh. The archive on the server is managed with it.

* Index 

copy and paste
http://wiki.theanarchistlibrary.org/index.php?title=Uploads_sorted_by_Authors&action=edit
in a new file and run 

 wiki-author-parser.sh file.wiki

It will produce two files: authors.html and text-index.html.
Paste their content in http://beta.theanarchistlibrary.org/author
and http://beta.theanarchistlibrary.org/texts-sorted-title

For the Topic index you have to copy and paste the source of
http://beta.theanarchistlibrary.org/admin/content/taxonomy/1 and
following pages in an empty file (use control-u in firefox)
and run 

 tagadelic.sh tags.list 

This will produce tags.html, which you can put in
http://beta.theanarchistlibrary.org/topics
